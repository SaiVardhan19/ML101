**ML101:**

This repository contains three machine learning projects I have worked on, focusing on different classification tasks: Spam SMS Recognition, Fraud Credit Card Transactions Detection, and Customer Churn Prediction. Each project uses various classifiers such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.

**Projects Overview:**
1. **Spam SMS Recognition**
This project aims to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate (ham). The dataset used contains a collection of SMS messages labeled accordingly. The main goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify spam messages using text classification techniques.

2.**Fraud Credit Card Transactions Detection:**
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset includes transactions with labels indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent. The objective is to build a model that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions to prevent financial losses.

3.**Customer Churn Prediction:**
This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn based on their interaction and transaction history. The dataset includes customer information and their churn status. The goal is to build a model that can predict customer churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.
